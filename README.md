# Tasking
google apps script based tasking application with a Parse NoSQL back-end.

# Overview
Originally this application used google's built-in NoSQL database ScriptDB, but as Google removed that service, this application needed to a massive overhaul.


# Installation
Moving scripts without tons of copy/paste into Google Drive can be relatively tricky. Please follow these instructions:
* Create an Apps Script Project on your Drive (you may need to connect Apps Script to Drive)
* Follow [these instructions on how to connect Eclipse with Google Apps Script](http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/10/total-eclipse-of-apps-script.html)
